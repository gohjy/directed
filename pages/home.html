                Note: Directed is in beta right now! Expect things to break or not work properly! If you have any feedback, let me know - scroll down to the bottom of the page to see how.

                Directed is a simple redirection service that redirects you to the page you're looking for.

            <p>
                For easy access, you can drag this bookmarklet to your bookmarks bar:
                <a href="javascript:(()=>{const p=prompt('Page:');if(p)location.assign(`https://gohjy.github.io/directed/?to=${encodeURIComponent(p)}`);})();">Directed shortcut</a>. 
                (On mobile devices, bookmark this page then edit the bookmark and copy and paste the link address above into the URL field.)
            </p>
            <p>
                On Chrome and Edge, you can also set a shortcut for Directed - go to your browser settings and follow the steps for adding a site search.

        <div class="resize-container main center">
            <h2>Inspiration</h2>
            <p>
                Directed was born out of my personal frustration with Google's sponsored search results, which can sometimes number 3 or 4 per search and make it much harder to find the actual link I'm looking for.
            </p>
            <p>
                I use many online services with too many URLs to remember - sometimes more than one per service - but searching for the service on Google often returns many sponsored ads, some of which are phishing sites as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                Directed gets you direct to what you're looking for with just the service name - no fake sites, no sponsored ads.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="resize-container main center">
            <h2>Source</h2>
            <p>
                Directed's source code is available <a href="https://github.com/gohjy/directed" target="_blank">here</a> on GitHub; the data is over <a href="https://github.com/gohjy/directed-data" target="_blank">here</a>.
